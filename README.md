# basecamp-giphy
A Giphy bot of the simplest kind....only for Basecamp... written in Elixir!

# Setup

### Giphy API Key

>To use the GIPHY API, you'll need to obtain an API Key by creating an app. You'll need a GIPHY account to create an app (don't worry, it's free!) Each application you create will have its own API Key. Don't worry if you're not sure what you want to use the GIPHY API for yet, all that's needed to create an app is a name and a basic description, which can be changed at any time.
